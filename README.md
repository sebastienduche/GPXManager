# GPXManager
Java Swing application to edit and merge GPX files

Development in progress...

My need was to be able to merge several GPX files following a several days bike ride. Instead of having a GPX track for each day, I wanted to have a unique GPX file with the full route.
So I started creating this application.
Currently, the application allows to:
- Open / Save GPX files
- Display and edit metadatas

Will come soon:
- Display some information about the track
- Merge several GPX files in 1
- Display some graphs

Probably the application will never display the GPX file on a map.
